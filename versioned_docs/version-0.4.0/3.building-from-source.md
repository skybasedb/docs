title: Building from source
---
Of course you can build it from source &mdash; that is, if you don't mind running a few commands on the terminal, downlaoding some files and moving around some files.

### Step 1: Install Rust
As TerrabaseDB is written in Rust, you'll have to install the Rust toolchain to build it (a little messy, but not too messy). Go to [this page](https://rustup.rs/) to set up Rust on your local machine.

### Step 2: Clone the tag
Run this from your terminal:
```
git clone --branch v0.4.0 https://github.com/skytable/skytable.git
```
:::tip Bonus tip
If you want to avoid downloading all the version history, run this instead:
```
git clone --depth 1 --branch v0.4.0 https://github.com/skytable/skytable.git
```
:::
### Step 3: Build it!
Expecting that you're still in the same directory, run:
```
cd skybase && cargo build --release
```
:::note
This will take a **long time** so hold on until Cargo finishes building things
:::
### Step 4: Get the binaries
You'll need to copy `tdb` and `tsh` (or `tdb.exe` and `tsh.exe` if on Windows) from the `skybase/target/release` folder. Be sure to copy these **exact files** and not something else!
### Step 5: Run it!
You can now follow the instructions [here](getting-started).
