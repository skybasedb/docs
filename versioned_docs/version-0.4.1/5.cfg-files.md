title: Configuration Files

TerrabaseDB supports custom configuration files to let users customize the functioning of TDB. Arguably, TDB has one of the simplest configuration files around.

## An example configuration

A configuration file is a TOML file, which looks like:

``` toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 2003
noart = false
```

This is the default configuration used by TDB when you don't specify a configuration file. Let's understand what each of the keys mean:

* `host` : This is the IP address to which you want the database server to bind to. It can be any valid IPv4 *or* IPv6 address, as a quoted string
* `port` : This is the port to which you want TDB to bind to
* `noart` (OPTIONAL): This is **an optional argument** and is recommended for secure environments where displaying terminal artwork might cause problems

## Using a configuration file

To use a configuration file:

1. Create it! We recommend you to name it as `tdb.toml` for easy identification
2. Start the database server with: `tdb -c /path/to/your/file.toml`
3. Done ðŸŽ‰

That's all that's there for using configuration files!

:::tip Bonus tip
If you're using a custom host/port, then you can bind `tsh` to a custom host/port by starting `tsh` like:
```shell
tsh [HOST] [PORT]
```
