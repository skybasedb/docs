We have an easy-to-follow guide for [Getting Started](getting-started). Once you've got everything up and running, you can take a look at the available actions [here](actions/overview) and [configuration files](config-files).

## Developers	

You can find information on how to build your own clients [here](Protocol/terrapipe). The primary idea is to implement the Terrapipe Protocol.
