Getting started with TerrabaseDB is easy ðŸ˜Š (and fun!).

### Step 1: Download a bundle

Head over to [this page](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/releases/v0.4.1) and download a version for your platform. Here's a little guide:

* If you're on Linux: Download `tdb-bundle-0.4.1-x86_64-linux-gnu.zip`
* If you're using macOS: Download `tdb-bundle-0.4.1-x86_64-macos.zip`
* If you're on Windows: Download `tdb-bundle-0.4.1-x86_64-windows.zip`

### Step 2: Make the files runnable

Unzip the `zip` file that you just downloaded. If you're on a *nix system, run `chmod +x tdb tsh` to make the files executable. If you're on Windows, right-click the files and then check the `UNBLOCK` checkbox and click on the `APPLY` button.

### Step 3: Start the database server

In the directory where you extracted the files, run `./tdb` on *nix systems or simply `tdb` on Windows systems. That's all there is to starting the database server!

### Step 4: Run the shell `tsh`

`tsh` is the shell that is shipped with the bundle. Run it, just like you did with the database server. Now enter commands in the shell, and have fun! First run `HEYA` to check if everything is fine - the server should reply with _HEY!_.

You're done with setting up `tdb` ðŸŽ‰!
