Welcome to Skytable's docs! You will find information about how you can get started with Skytable, installation options, configuration and clients.

:::note Caution
This documentation is for Skytable versions built off the `next` branch and is not very stable. To use a pre-built binary and see its corresponding instructions, click on the version dropdown towards the upper left to select a version.
:::

## Users

Since you're building off `next`, you'll have to [build from source](building-from-source). Once you've got everything up and running, you can take a look at the available actions [here](actions/overview) and [configuration files](config-files).

## Developers	

You can find information on how to build your own clients [here](Protocol/terrapipe). The primary idea is to implement the Terrapipe Protocol.
