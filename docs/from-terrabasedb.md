title: "Migrating from TerrabaseDB"
---

As of v0.5.0, which is currently the latest release — the binaries released are still under the 'TerrabaseDB' name. In that event, please visit the archived docs for TerrabaseDB [here](https://docs.archive.skybasedb.com) where you can find TDB's documentation. 
Once we push a new release, you shouldn't have trouble using this documentation site! 

If you want to use this new site, all you need to do is replace 'sdb' with 'tdb', 'skysh' with 'tsh' and 'sky-bench' with 'tdb-bench'; yeah — not much has changed!

If you're running your own build off [next](http://github.com/skybasedb/skybase/tree/next), you're ready to roll!
